- Exploration of an image segmentation vision language model (Med-VLM) that uses a language description of the organ's anatomical location to supposedly enhance the segmentation accuracy. My implementation applies the method to a smaller CT organ dataset and performed segmentation on 2D CT slices, compared to the original implementation that used multiple large datasets and segmented using the full 3D CT images
